 * calculate the time and the number of terms that were generated and added to
 * generate the number pi with a certain significant digit accuracy. 
 * The program finally prints the generated PI, and contrasts it with the

 * significant figure the values start to diverge and then prints the number of 
 * terms calculated followed by the time (in sec or ms) used to generate the 
 * number PI.
 * 		Notice that the number -1 is used to provide the alternating pattern 
 * in the taylor series used in this function, and the number 4 is used to 
 * perform calculations described int the formula above.
